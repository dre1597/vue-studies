# Border previewer

## About

I already have a project for [border-radius previewer](https://github.com/dre1597/border-radius-previewer) using plain HTML/CSS. The idea for this project is to make more border options (to keep the old project just with border-radius) and practice Vue.

This project is from this [idea](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Bin2Dec-App.md)

## Functionalities to add

-   Border-radius preview
-   More options to border like width, style, color
-   Option to copy to clipboard
-   Option to change the background color and text color of the page

## Technologies

-   Vue
-   SASS
